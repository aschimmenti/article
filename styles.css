/*First we select the element(s) we want to flex.
section has three article children, so: 
- section is the flex container (display: flex;)
-- articles are the flex items (flex: n = 1,2,3...; we can also tell the minim size we want the columns) 

The flex items work as multiple columns, each of the same height, and they flex towards the direction
we want: 
- if flex-direction: column; they will occupy each one row as a full column
- if flex-direction: row; they will try to occupy as much of the row as possible with multiple columns
- flex-wrap tells if the columns must wrap based on some width rule
